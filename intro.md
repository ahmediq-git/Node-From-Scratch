# Introduction

Node.js is the ECMAscript runtime environment for the web.

Chrome uses an engine called V8 that has been written in C++ that executes ECMAscript code.

We can integrate V8 in a C++ application and build further Javascript/ECMAscript functionalities of things found in Cpp but not in ES.

File handling was supported in Cpp but not in js, so Node makes Js implement file handling
